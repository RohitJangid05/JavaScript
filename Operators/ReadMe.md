JavaScript operators are symbols used to perform operations on values and variables. Hereâ€™s a summary of different types of operators in JavaScript:

1. Arithmetic Operators
    These operators perform basic mathematical operations.

/+ : Addition
/- : Subtraction
/* : Multiplication
// : Division
/% : Modulus (remainder)
/++ : Increment
/-- : Decrement

2. Assignment Operators
    These assign values to variables.

 = : Simple assignment
 += : Add and assign
 -= : Subtract and assign
 *= : Multiply and assign
 /= : Divide and assign
 %= : Modulus and assign

3. Comparison Operators
    These compare two values and return a boolean (true or false).

== : Equal to
=== : Strict equal to (checks both value and type)
!= : Not equal to
!== : Strict not equal to
> : Greater than
< : Less than
>= : Greater than or equal to
<= : Less than or equal to

4. Logical Operators
These are used to perform logical operations.

&& : Logical AND
|| : Logical OR
! : Logical NOT

5. Bitwise Operators
These operate on binary representations of numbers.

& : Bitwise AND
| : Bitwise OR
^ : Bitwise XOR
~ : Bitwise NOT
<< : Left shift
>> : Right shift
>>> : Zero fill right shift

6. Ternary (Conditional) Operator
This is the shorthand for an if-else statement.

condition ? expression1 : expression2

7. Type Operators
typeof : Returns the type of a variable
instanceof : Checks if an object is an instance of a specific class.

8. Spread Operator (...)
