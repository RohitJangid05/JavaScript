Function in Javascript
    A function in JavaScript is a reusable block of code designed to perform a specific task. Functions can accept inputs (called parameters) and can return an output using the return statement.

Function Expression
    In JavaScript, a function expression is a way to define a function and assign it to a variable. Unlike a function declaration, the function expression is not hoisted, meaning it can only be used after it has been defined.

Anonymous Function
    An anonymous function is a function that is defined without a name. In JavaScript, anonymous functions are often used in situations where the function does not need to be reused, such as being passed as an argument to another function or assigned to a variable.
