JavaScript regular expressions (regex) are patterns used to match character combinations in strings. These can be used for validation, search, extraction, and replacement of text.

Basic Syntax:
    /pattern/modifiers: The pattern is placed between slashes, and modifiers follow the second slash.
Modifiers control how the pattern is applied, e.g., case sensitivity or global search.
Common Modifiers:
    g : Global search (find all matches, not just the first).
    i : Case-insensitive search.
    m : Multi-line search.
    \s : white spaces
