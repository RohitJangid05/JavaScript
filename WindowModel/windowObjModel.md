Window
    The window object represents the global window in a browser. Both the Browser Object Model (BOM) and the Document Object Model (DOM) are part of the window object.

Browser Object Model (BOM):
    The BOM represents the browser as an object and provides methods and properties for interacting with the browser itself (not directly related to the content of a web page).

    Examples of BOM features include window.navigator for browser information, window.location for URL manipulation, and window.alert for displaying alerts.

Document Object Model (DOM):
    The DOM represents the structured document as a tree of objects, where each object corresponds to a part of the document (such as elements, attributes, and text).

    The DOM is primarily concerned with the content of the web page allows JavaScript to    interact with and manipulate the HTML elem

Conclusion:
    So, while the DOM is focused on the content of the page, the BOM is focused on the browser environment. The window object serves as the global object that encompasses both the BOM and the DOM when working in a browser environment.
