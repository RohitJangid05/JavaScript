Conditional statements control the flow of the program based on conditions. The most common conditional statements are

if Statement
    Executes a block of code if the condition is true.

if...else Statement
    Executes one block of code if the condition is true, and another if the condition is false.

else if Statement
    Allows checking multiple conditions.

switch Statement
    Executes a block of code based on different cases. It is an alternative to multiple if...else if statements.

Loops in JavaScript
    Loops are used to repeatedly run a block of code as long as the specified condition is true.

for Loop
    The for loop repeats a block of code a certain number of times.

while Loop
    Executes a block of code as long as the condition is true.

do...while Loop
    Similar to the while loop, but it guarantees that the block of code will be executed at least once, even if the condition is false.

for...in Loop
    Used to loop through the properties of an object.

for...of Loop
    Used to loop through the values of an iterable (like an array or string).
