In JavaScript, the Math object provides a set of built-in methods and properties that are used to perform mathematical operations. The Math object is not a constructor, so all its properties and methods are static, meaning they can be accessed directly without creating an instance.

    Returns a random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).

Math.round(x)
    Rounds a number to the nearest integer

Math.floor(x)
    Rounds a number down to the nearest integer.

Math.ceil(x)
    Rounds a number up to the nearest integer.

Math.trunc(x)
    Returns the integer part of a number by removing any fractional digits.

Math.pow(base, exponent)
    Returns the result of raising a base to the power of an exponent.

Math.sqrt(x)
    Returns the square root of a number.

Math.max(1, 2, 3, ...)
