In JavaScript, a string is a sequence of characters used to represent text. Strings can be created using either single quotes ('), double quotes ("), or backticks (`).

Common String Methods:
    Length: string.length - returns the length of the string.
    Concatenation: string1 + string2 or string1.concat(string2) - combines two strings.
    Access character: string[index] - retrieves the character at a specific index.
    Substring: string.substring(start, end) - extracts part of the string.
    Includes: string.includes(substring) - checks if a substring exists in the string.
    Replace: string.replace('old', 'new') - replaces a part of the string.
